# About Me

## Designing with Words

With 10 years of experience in technical communication, I can create user-centered content for product interfaces and help systems. I have always advocated for clear, consistent writing that facilitates understanding of complex concepts and task completion. My body of work includes documentation, microcopy, style guides, terminology lists, and process documents.

## Why Technical Communication

Learning and organizing form the foundation of my life choices and body of work. I assimilate information quickly and relate it to what I already know, creating an internal structure that facilitates retention.

Product users expect technical content to explain unfamiliar concepts and procedures. To effectively teach and guide, I must first determine their informational needs and study the product itself. Technical communication, therefore, allows me to expand my knowledge while helping others do the same.

# What I Do

## UX Writing

_Creating user-centered content for web and mobile applications_

I write interface text (also known as "microcopy") that addresses what users feel and need at each step of their user journey.

I specialize in structured authoring, which is a standardized, methodological approach to content creation.
